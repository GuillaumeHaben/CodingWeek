## Presentation ##

The application is able to search and collect data from tweets. Data are collected according to hashtags, keywords, dates, language, username with a potential period (1h,24h) and are saved in a database. We can also make searches with differents parameters at the same time. 

The added value of our application is the treatments processing the data collected and interpreting them (map).

## Installation ##

Download the java files and run it on an IDE

## How it works ? ##

After running the app, a very nice and beautiful (maybe wild) window appears and from this, you can follow the instruction to get the information you need from the app.
